<p>Each of the above items will be explained below.</p>

Resolve dissatisfaction with the current situation constructively
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
Are you dissatisfied with current software development?</p>
<ul>
<li>If your boss doesn&#39;t like it,</li>
<li>The performance of the development PC is poor,</li>
<li>low wages or</li>
<li>a lot of overtime or</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The &#34;dissatisfaction&#34; I am talking about is not the &#34;dissatisfaction with the real world&#34; surrounding software development mentioned above,</strong></p>
<p>
To realize the idea in my head when doing software development</p>
<ul>
<li>It is easy to bug due to language specifications,</li>
<li>You can only write in a troublesome way that takes a lot of time and effort,</li>
<li>You have to create the necessary utility from scratch, and it takes too much time to get to what you want to create.</li>
<li>In the first place, it can not be realized due to the language specification,</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#39;s my dissatisfaction with programming languages.</p>
<p>
For those who have such complaints, and who have concrete ideas to solve them, I encourage them to develop a transcompiler.</p>
<p>
This is the main reason why I wanted to develop a transcompiler myself.</p>
<p>
&#34;If you don&#39;t have it, you can make it yourself&#34;</p>
<p>
Aren&#39;t you a &#34;software engineer&#34; because you have the ability to realize your ideas with software?</p>

Why it&#39;s a &#34;transcompiler&#34; and not a &#34;compiler&#34;
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-4">
<p>
“Why “transcompiler” instead of “compiler”? ] You may be wondering.</p>
<p>
This is because the technical hurdles of creating a &#34;transcompiler&#34; are lower than creating a &#34;compiler.&#34; With the advent of LLVM, I think the hurdles for compiler development are lower than before, but the hurdles for transcompilers are still lower.</p>
<p>
Especially, when there is a bug in the code after compiling, the transcompiler is overwhelmingly lower in &#34;cause-seeking cost&#34;.</p>
<p>
If creating a compiler is the goal in itself, I think that&#39;s fine, but creating a compiler is a means, and the ultimate goal is to solve &#34;dissatisfaction with the programming language.&#34;</p>
<p>
It would be better if it can be realized with as little cost as possible.</p>
<p>
Besides, most of the &#34;frustration with programming languages&#34; can be solved with a transcompiler.</p>
<p>
Of course, for complaints such as &#34;I want to shorten the compile time&#34;, I think that I have to develop a compiler by myself, but most other complaints can be solved with a transcompiler.</p>
<p>
Even if the ultimate goal is to build a compiler,</p>
<ul>
<li>First create a transcompiler,</li>
<li>Demonstrate that dissatisfaction can be resolved and that it is easy to use as a language,</li>
<li>It can be confirmed that using the transcompiler is beneficial,</li>
<li>Then after you need to compile directly to native</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, developing a compiler can be said to be the most efficient method.</p>

Why it&#39;s a &#34;transcompiler&#34; instead of an &#34;interpreter&#34;
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-4">
<p>
The reason why it&#39;s not a &#34;compiler&#34; is explained above.</p>
<p>
Here&#39;s why it&#39;s not an &#34;interpreter&#34;.</p>
<p>
Even if I say that, the reason is the same as the time of &#34;compiler&#34;, because &#34;hurdles are lower&#34; than &#34;interpreter&#34;.</p>
<p>
Writing an interpreter is a lower hurdle than a compiler. I myself have experience making simple interpreters several times.</p>
<p>
But when it comes to practical interpreters, it&#39;s a different story. When it comes to a practical interpreter, there are development man-hour problems and execution performance problems. As I wrote at the time of the compiler, the purpose is to solve &#34;dissatisfaction with the programming language&#34;, so let&#39;s not think about anything other than that.</p>
<p>
There are many practical interpreted languages (scripting languages) out there today. You won&#39;t have to bother making your own.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-5" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-5">
Easy-to-understand output results
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-4">
<p>
One of the advantages of transcompilers over compilers is that the output code of transcompilers is easy for many people to understand.</p>
<p>
When it comes to which is easier to understand, the &#34;native code&#34; output by the compiler and the &#34;code in a certain language&#34; output by the transcompiler, everyone agrees that the &#34;code in a certain language&#34; is easier to understand. .</p>
<p>
If you ask, &#34;Why is it better to be easy to understand?&#34;, it means that the introduction risk is that low.</p>
<p>
When introducing new technology into a project, we need to decide whether it is &#34;safe&#34;.</p>
<p>
The term “safety” can mean many different things.</p>
<ul>
<li>&#34;Information security&#34; to ensure that virus-like things do not enter</li>
<li>Whether it can be exported overseas and whether it is subject to the &#34;Foreign Exchange Law&#34;</li>
<li>Are there any licensing issues? Even if there is no problem with the license of the part created by the author of the compiler, is there a license problem with the code that the author unintentionally uses?</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to introduce other new things, we need to clear some safety.</p>
<p>
When clearing these safety requirements, it is very important to make the target technology easy to understand.</p>
<p>
In the case of compilers, it is impractical to inspect the generated native code, so the compiler&#39;s code is inspected for safety.</p>
<p>
A transcompiler, on the other hand, only needs to look at the license and the converted code.</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-headline-6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-6">
You can check trending technology
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
If you go to great lengths to develop a new transcompiler, it&#39;s the nature of engineers to try to make it as user-friendly as possible.</p>
<p>
In that case, it is common practice to investigate the characteristics of various languages and incorporate the good ones.</p>
<p>
When developing LuneScript, I also investigated as many languages as possible and tried to incorporate various functions.</p>
<p>
What is the point of knowing the characteristics of different languages? For example, is it meaningful for engineers who are usually only involved in C language projects to know the features of Go and swift? I&#39;m sure some people wonder about such things.</p>
<p>
If you are someone who regularly collects new information on sites such as Qiita, I don&#39;t think you will have any doubts about such things, but if you don&#39;t, there will be more than a few people who do. .</p>
<p>
I think that even if you are an engineer who is usually only involved in C language projects, you should be aware of the features of the modern language.</p>
<p>
This is because even if the features of modern language itself cannot be used in C language, the way of thinking and the essence can be introduced in C language as well.</p>
<p>
For example, the concept of a functional language can be implemented in C without using Haskell.</p>
<p>
Of course, there are things that are difficult to write with the C language syntax, and things that cannot be realized due to the C language specifications.</p>
<p>
However, there is a difference between knowing the concept of a functional language and intentionally writing in a C-like way, and writing in C as usual because you only know the C language.</p>
<p>
Also, incorporating the features of the modern language as a transcompiler function will enable a deeper understanding than simply using the modern language. Without a deep understanding, it cannot be taken in.</p>
<p>
In this way, it can be said that the development of a transcompiler is a good experience in order to deepen the understanding of the characteristics of modern languages.</p>

<h3 id="headline-7">
Coding rules can be corrected
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
This is a little different from what I&#39;ve mentioned so far, but I think it&#39;s pretty important.</p>
<p>
I think everyone has an ideal way of writing when coding, such as &#34;I want to write like this&#34; and &#34;I should write like this&#34;.</p>
<p>
Developing a transcompiler also means being able to correct (enforce) coding rules at the language level.</p>
<p>
I think that there are many people who have doubts about this explanation, &#34;What do you mean?&#34;, but I think that it will be understood by saying &#34;block by indentation&#34; in python.</p>
<p>
Python represents blocks by indentation, not by keywords or delimiters.</p>
<p>
In other words, instead of binding a coding rule that &#34;blocks should be indented&#34;, Python corrects (enforces) at the language level that &#34;if the indentation is not complete, it cannot be treated as a block&#34;.</p>
<p>
Coding rules are often controversial. Developing your own transcompiler prevents such useless disputes at the language level.</p>
<p>
I wasn&#39;t very conscious of it until I developed my own transcompiler, but among the coding rules I&#39;m usually conscious of, there are some rules that are unnecessary in other languages because they can&#39;t be enforced at the language level. I understand.</p>
<p>
When developing a new language, I think you should not only incorporate new functions, but also review your usual coding rules and consider whether it can be handled at the language level.</p>

<div id="outline-text-headline-8" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
So far, I have made simple interpreters and <a href="../../lctags/">source code tag system</a> as a hobby.</p>
<p>
Through LuneScript development this time, I was able to realize the fun of software development once again.</p>
<p>
I think there are many people who think that there is no point in creating a new language now. At least I thought so.</p>
<p>
However, by developing LuneScript this time, I think I was able to grow as a software engineer.</p>
<p>
No matter what people think, if you can feel the growth yourself, that&#39;s the best.</p>
<p>
If you are dissatisfied with software development, please try to develop a new programming language.</p>

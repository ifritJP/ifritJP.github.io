I am developing a transcompiler called LuneScript.</p>

Through this development, I feel that I have had a good experience as an engineer.</p>
<p>
The reason for developing LuneScript is described in the next article.</p>

<p>
I decided to write this article because I wanted many people to experience transcompiler development for the following reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can constructively resolve dissatisfaction with the current situation</li>
<li>You can check the trend technology</li>
<li>Can correct coding rules</li>
</ul>
<p>In the following, we will explain each of the above items.</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-2">
Can constructively resolve dissatisfaction with the current situation
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
Are you dissatisfied with your current software development?</p>
<ul>
<li>I don&#39;t like my boss</li>
<li>The performance of the development PC is shobo,</li>
<li>The salary is cheap,</li>
<li>There is a lot of overtime</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The &#34;dissatisfaction&#34; I am talking about is not the &#34;dissatisfaction with the real world&#34; surrounding software development mentioned above.</strong></p>
<p>
To realize the ideas in my head when developing software</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#39;s easy to bug due to language specifications</li>
<li>You can only write in a very time-consuming and troublesome way</li>
<li>You have to make the utility-like things necessary to realize it from scratch, and it takes too much time to reach what you originally wanted to make.</li>
<li>In the first place, it can not be realized in terms of language specifications</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;m dissatisfied with the programming language.</p>
<p>
For those who have such dissatisfaction and have specific ideas for resolving the dissatisfaction, we recommend developing a transcompiler.</p>
<p>
This is the number one reason I decided to develop a transcompiler myself.</p>
<p>
&#34;If you don&#39;t have one, you can make it yourself.&#34;</p>
<p>
Isn&#39;t it a &#34;software engineer&#34; because he has the ability to realize ideas with software?</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-3" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-3">
Why it&#39;s a &#34;transcompiler&#34; rather than a &#34;compiler&#34;
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-4">
<p>
&#34;Why is it a&#34; transcompiler &#34;instead of a&#34; compiler &#34;? You may be wondering.</p>
<p>
This is because the &#34;transcompiler&#34; has lower technical hurdles than the &#34;compiler&#34;. With the advent of LLVM, I think the hurdles for compiler development are lower than before, but the hurdles for transcompilers are still lower.</p>
<p>
In particular, the &#34;cause-seeking cost&#34; when there is a bug in the compiled code is overwhelmingly lower with the transcompiler.</p>
<p>
I think it&#39;s okay if the purpose is to make a compiler, but making a compiler is a means, and the purpose is to solve &#34;dissatisfaction with programming languages&#34;.</p>
<p>
It would be better if it could be achieved at the lowest possible cost.</p>
<p>
Besides, most of the &#34;dissatisfaction with programming languages&#34; can be solved by a transcompiler.</p>
<p>
Of course, if you have a complaint like &#34;I want to shorten the compilation time&#34;, I think that I have to develop the compiler by myself, but most of the other complaints can be solved by the transcompiler.</p>
<p>
Even if the ultimate goal is to build a compiler</p>
<ul>
<li>First, create a transcompiler,</li>
<li>Demonstrate that dissatisfaction can be resolved and that it is easy to use as a language,</li>
<li>I found it beneficial to use that transcompiler,</li>
<li>After that, when I needed to compile directly to native</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, developing a compiler is an efficient way to do it.</p>

<h4 id="headline-4">
Why it&#39;s a &#34;transcompiler&#34; rather than an &#34;interpreter&#34;
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-4">
<p>
I mentioned above why it is not a &#34;compiler&#34;.</p>
<p>
Here&#39;s why it&#39;s not an &#34;interpreter&#34;.</p>
<p>
That said, the reason is the same as when it was a &#34;compiler&#34;, because it has a &#34;lower hurdle&#34; than an &#34;interpreter&#34;.</p>
<p>
Creating an interpreter is a lower hurdle than a compiler. I myself have made several simple interpreters.</p>
<p>
But when it comes to practical interpreters, it&#39;s a different story. When it comes to a practical interpreter, there are problems with development man-hours and problems with execution performance. As I wrote when I was a compiler, the purpose is to solve &#34;dissatisfaction with programming languages&#34;, so let&#39;s not think about anything else.</p>
<p>
There are many practical interpreted languages (scripting languages) in the world now. You don&#39;t have to bother to make it yourself.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-5" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-5">
Easy to understand output result
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-4">
<p>
One of the advantages of a transcompiler over a compiler is that the output code of the transcompiler is easy for many to understand.</p>
<p>
As for which is easier to understand, the &#34;native code&#34; output by the compiler or the &#34;code in a certain language&#34; output by the transcompiler, everyone agrees that the &#34;code in a certain language&#34; is easier to understand. ..</p>
<p>
&#34;Why should it be easy to understand?&#34; Means that the introduction risk is that low.</p>
<p>
When introducing a new technology into a project, you need to determine if it is &#34;safe&#34;.</p>
<p>
There are various points of view even if we simply say &#34;safety&#34;.</p>
<ul>
<li>&#34;Information security&#34; that guarantees that no virus-like things have entered</li>
<li>Whether it can be exported overseas or is subject to the &#34;Foreign Exchange Law&#34;</li>
<li>Is there a problem with the license? Even if the license of the part created by the author of the compiler is okay, is there a license issue in the code that the author unintentionally uses?</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to introduce other new ones, it is necessary to clear some safety.</p>
<p>
In clearing these safety, the clarity of the target technology is very important.</p>
<p>
For compilers, it&#39;s impractical to look at the generated native code, so you&#39;ll have to look at the compiler&#39;s code to make sure it&#39;s safe.</p>
<p>
The transcompiler, on the other hand, only needs to look at the license and the converted code.</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-headline-6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-6">
You can check the trend technology
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
If you are developing a new transcompiler, it is the nature of the engineer to try to make it as easy to use as possible.</p>
<p>
If so, it is customary to investigate the characteristics of different languages and capture the good ones.</p>
<p>
As I developed LuneScript, I intend to research as many languages as possible and incorporate various features.</p>
<p>
What does it mean to know the characteristics of different languages? For example, does it make sense for engineers who are usually only involved in C language projects to know the characteristics of Go and swift? I&#39;m sure some people wonder about that.</p>
<p>
If you are a person who usually collects new information on sites such as Qiita, you will not have any doubts about such things, but if not, many people will wonder. ..</p>
<p>
I think that even engineers who are usually involved only in C language projects should understand the characteristics of Imadoki&#39;s language.</p>
<p>
The reason is that even if the characteristics of Imadoki&#39;s language itself cannot be used in C language, ideas and essences can be introduced in C language as well.</p>
<p>
For example, the idea of a functional language itself can be realized in C without using Haskell.</p>
<p>
Of course, there are things that are difficult to write with C language syntax, and things that cannot be realized due to the C language specifications.</p>
<p>
However, there is a difference between writing in C language after knowing the concept of functional language itself and writing in C language as usual because you only know C language.</p>
<p>
In addition, incorporating the characteristics of the Imadoki language as a function of the transcompiler enables a deeper understanding than simply using the Imadoki language. Or rather, it cannot be captured without a deep understanding.</p>
<p>
In this way, it can be said that the development of a transcompiler is a good experience to deepen the understanding of the characteristics of Imadoki&#39;s language.</p>

<h3 id="headline-7">
Can correct coding rules
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
This is a little different from what I&#39;ve mentioned so far, but I think it&#39;s quite important.</p>
<p>
I think everyone has an ideal way of writing, such as &#34;I want to write this&#34; and &#34;I should write this&#34; when coding.</p>
<p>
Developing a transcompiler also means that you can correct (enforce) your coding rules at the language level.</p>
<p>
Many people may wonder, &#34;What do you mean?&#34; With this explanation, but I think you can say &#34;block by indentation&#34; in python.</p>
<p>
Python represents blocks by indentation rather than keywords or delimiters.</p>
<p>
In other words, instead of binding &#34;blocks should be indented&#34; with coding rules, Python corrects (forces) &#34;if the indents are not aligned, it should not be treated as a block&#34; at the language level.</p>
<p>
Coding rules are often controversial. Developing your own transcompiler can prevent such useless controversy at the language level.</p>
<p>
I wasn&#39;t really aware of it until I developed my own transcompiler, but there are some coding rules that I&#39;m usually aware of that are no longer needed because they can&#39;t be implemented at the language level in another language. I found out.</p>
<p>
When developing a new language, I think you should not only incorporate new features, but also review your usual coding rules and consider whether you can handle it at the language level.</p>

<div id="outline-text-headline-8" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
So far, I have made simple interpreters and <a href="../../ lctags /] [source code tag system">../../ lctags /] [source code tag system</a> as a hobby.</p>
<p>
Through the development of LuneScript this time, I was able to realize another fun of software development.</p>
<p>
I think many people think that there is no point in creating a new language. At least I thought so.</p>
<p>
However, by developing LuneScript this time, I think I was able to grow as a software engineer again.</p>
<p>
It&#39;s best if you can feel the growth yourself no matter what you think.</p>
<p>
If you are dissatisfied with software development, please try to develop a new programming language.</p>

LuneScript supports transcompiling to lua and go.

On the other hand, lua and go have different directory management methods.

This section describes the recommended directory structure so that you can use it in directory management in either language without any problems.


* Premise

The explanation here assumes that you are developing with the following github repository.
: github.com/HOGE/PROJ

- HOGE is any github account name.
- PROJ is any repository name.
In addition, the explanation is based on the assumption that the following modules are defined.
: foo.bar.lib



* Basic configuration

Shows the basic structure of the directory.
#+BEGIN_SRC txt
PROJ/
 +-- go.mod
 +-- lune.js
 +-- foo/
   +-- bar/
      +-- lib.lns
#+END_SRC


Place go.mod, lune.js, and foo / directly under the PROJ directory.


** lune.js

lune.js is created with the following contents.
: {}



** go.mod

The configuration of go.mod at this time is shown. Note that go.mod is not needed if you do not transcompile to go.
#+BEGIN_SRC txt
module github.com/HOGE/PROJ

go 1.16
#+END_SRC



** Main and sub modules

*The repository may manage the main program and the submodules used by the main program.*

*When managed as a submodule, the above basic structure restrictions are slightly relaxed.*

Specifically, the following are mitigated:
- You don't have to have go.mod, lune.js, foo directly under PROJ.
- You no longer need to register go.sum on github.
For example, it can be placed under src as follows.
#+BEGIN_SRC txt
PROJ/
 +-- src/  <--- ※任意のディレクトリ以下に配置可能
   +-- go.mod
   +-- lune.js
   +-- foo/
     +-- bar/
        +-- lib.lns
#+END_SRC


In this case, go.mod has a different module path as follows:
#+BEGIN_SRC txt
module github.com/HOGE/PROJ/src

go 1.16
#+END_SRC



** Environment variable GOPATH

When transcompiling to go, the above PROJ directory must be placed in the following location.
: ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/HOGE/PROJ


If GOPATH is not set, =${HOME}/go= will be used.
